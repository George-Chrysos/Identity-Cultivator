# Cultivator Identity Evolution System - README

A comprehensive life RPG progression system that gamifies personal development through identity cultivation.

## 🎯 Core Concept

The system transforms daily habits into an RPG-like progression where users cultivate different "identities" through consistent daily task completion. Each identity follows a tier-based evolution system inspired by cultivation novels.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Identity Progression System

**Tiers & Requirements:**
- **Tier D**: 5 days per level (Levels 1-10)
- **Tier C**: 10 days per level (Levels 1-10)  
- **Tier B**: 15 days per level (Levels 1-10)
- **Tier A**: 20 days per level (Levels 1-10)
- **Tier S**: 30 days per level (Levels 1-8)

**Evolution Rules:**
- Complete Level 10 → Evolve to next tier + reset to Level 1
- Missing 3+ consecutive days → Decay (lose progress days)
- Single toggle button: Complete/Reverse daily task

## 🎯 Files Created/Updated

### Core System Files:
1. **`src/models/cultivatorTypes.ts`** - TypeScript interfaces and types
2. **`src/api/cultivatorDatabase.ts`** - Database service layer
3. **`src/store/cultivatorStore.ts`** - Zustand state management
4. **`src/components/CultivatorCard.tsx`** - Identity card component
5. **`src/pages/CultivatorHomepage.tsx`** - Main page component
6. **`database/schema.sql`** - Database schema and queries

### Key Features Implemented:

✅ **Complete Identity System** with tier-based progression
✅ **Database Integration** ready (localStorage + SQL schema)
✅ **Cultivator Template** with 38 unique level names
✅ **React Components** with animations and responsive design
✅ **State Management** with Zustand persistence
✅ **Progress Tracking** with decay and streak systems
✅ **Mobile-First** UI with touch-friendly buttons
✅ **Animation System** for level-ups and evolutions

## 🚀 Usage

The system is now fully functional. Users can:
- Create cultivator identities
- Complete daily tasks with single button toggle
- Watch progress through tier evolution
- Experience celebration animations
- Track streaks and handle missed days

Run `npm run dev` to see the cultivator system in action!

## 📊 Database Ready

The system includes a complete SQL schema with optimized queries for:
- User management and tier tracking
- Identity creation and progress updates
- Task completion logging
- Decay handling for missed days
- Historical progress tracking

## 🎨 Extensible Design

Easy to extend with new identity types by:
1. Adding new templates to `cultivatorTypes.ts`
2. Creating custom UI components
3. Updating the database service

The foundation is set for a full cultivation-based life RPG system!
