## 🐛 Quick Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Login fails** | Check Google OAuth redirect URIs match |
| **Data not saving** | Verify Supabase env variables are set |
| **Build errors** | Run `npm install` then `npm run build` |
| **Can't push to GitHub** | Check .gitignore has `.env` |
| **Deployment fails** | Check Vercel logs, verify env vars |

---

## 💡 Quick Tips

1. **Never commit `.env`** - Contains secret keys
2. **Test locally first** - Before deploying
3. **Keep Supabase URL safe** - It's public but anon key expires
4. **Use descriptive commits** - "feat:", "fix:", "docs:"
5. **Pull before push** - Avoid conflicts
