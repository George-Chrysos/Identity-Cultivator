# ✅ Final Changes Summary - v0.1 Beta Release

## 🎉 All Tasks Completed!

### Task 1: ✅ 3 Default Identities on First Login

**What Changed:**
- New users now automatically get 3 starter identities:
  - **Cultivator** (Spiritual/Mental growth)
  - **Bodysmith** (Physical fitness)
  - **Pathweaver** (Learning & Skills)

**File Modified:**
- `src/store/cultivatorStore.ts` (line ~124)

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Old: Initialize with dummy data
await CultivatorDatabase.initializeWithDummyData(desiredUserID);

// New: Create 3 default identities
const defaultTypes: IdentityType[] = ['CULTIVATOR', 'BODYSMITH', 'PATHWEAVER'];
for (const identityType of defaultTypes) {
  await CultivatorDatabase.createIdentity({ userID: desiredUserID, identityType });
}
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Sign in with Google → Instantly see 3 identities ready to use
- ✅ No need to manually create first identities
- ✅ Immediate engagement with the app
- ✅ Can still create more identities (FITNESS, CREATIVE, SOCIAL)

  className="absolute top-3 right-3 p-2 rounded-lg bg-white/10 hover:bg-white/20..."
>
  <X className="h-5 w-5" />
</button>
```

**User Experience:**

<div className="mt-4 grid grid-cols-3 gap-2...">
  <button...>+5 Days</button>

## 📋 Known Limitations (For Beta)

Current limitations to communicate to testers:

1. **Single Path per Type:** Only one identity per type allowed
   - Can't have 2 Cultivators
   - Intentional design choice

2. **Max 5 Active Identities:** Hard limit to prevent overwhelm
   - Can create more but must deactivate others
   - Good for focus

3. **No Data Export:** Data stored in Supabase only
   - Future feature planned
   - Data is safe and backed up

4. **Calendar Timezone:** Uses browser's local time
   - Should work globally
   - Report if you see issues
